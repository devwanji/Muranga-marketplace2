Build a full-stack web application called Murang'a Marketplace, a local business listing platform. The site should have the following key features:
1. User Roles

    Admin (site owner) — full access to manage listings, users, and payments.

    Business Owners — can register and manage their business after payment.

    Customers — can browse and search businesses.

2. Business Registration Workflow

    Business owners must choose a payment plan:

        KES 200/month

        KES 3,000/year

    After selecting a plan, the system should prompt for M-Pesa payment. Integrate with Safaricom Daraja API to:

        Trigger STK Push to number 0714092658 (site owner's number).

        Let the user enter their M-Pesa PIN.

        Confirm payment before allowing business registration.

    Only after successful payment, allow the business to:

        Fill out a registration form with business name, location (Murang’a sub-counties), category (e.g., retail, service, food), contact info, and logo/photo.

3. Customer Features

    Search and filter businesses by name, category, or location.

    View business details (description, contact, image).
